Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... Highlights Flask wins for flexibility and customisation, letting you build apps exactly the way you want without restrictions. Django dominates with built-in features and rapid development, making it the go-to for large, complex projects. Choosing between them isn’t just features; it’s your team’s goals, scalability needs, and future growth plans. Introduction Python has earned its place as one of the world’s most loved programming languages. It is simple, readable, and powerful. But when it comes to web development with Python, two frameworks dominate every technical discussion: Flask and Django. At first glance, it seems simple. But if you’ve ever led a project, you know decisions aren’t that simple. Will Flask’s lightweight nature give your developers the freedom to build exactly what they want without constraints? Or will Django’s robust, ready-made features save your team countless development hours and ensure security best practices out of the box? Before your team commits to either, it’s worth digging deep & finding the right way forward. What is Flask? Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that lets you build web applications quickly and easily. Flask was created by Armin Ronacher, a well-known figure in the Python community, in 2010 & it got the attention it deserved right from the start. It’s called a “micro-framework” because it doesn’t come with built-in tools by default. Instead, it gives you the basics and the freedom to add only what your project needs using extensions. As per the Stack Overflow 2024 survey of top technologies, Flask ranks in the 10th position among the 36 technologies, with around 13% developers using it. For small projects, APIs, or when you want to keep things simple and flexible without the weight of a full-stack framework, Flask is an ideal option. What is Django? Django is a high-level web framework for Python designed that developers build robust, secure, and scalable web applications in no time. It was created back in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison. Since then, Django has grown into one of the most powerful frameworks, known for its security, scalability, and ability to handle high-traffic sites. Unlike micro-frameworks, Django comes with almost everything you need out of the box. That’s why it’s often described as a “batteries included” framework. As per the Stack Overflow 2024 survey of top technologies, Django ranks in the 12th position among the 36 technologies, with around 12% developers using it. If your project needs a solid foundation with built-in features to speed up development, Django is a framework worth considering.
