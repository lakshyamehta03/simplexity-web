Under Putin's proposal, Kyiv would cede swathes of its eastern land that Russia has been unable to capture, sources briefed on Moscow's thinking told Reuters. This would involve Kyiv fully withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk, which make up the eastern Donbas region that's rich in coal and critical minerals. Russia currently controls almost all of Luhansk and 70% of Donetsk. In return, Russia would pledge to freeze the front lines in the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. It would return smaller pockets of Ukraine's northern Sumy and northeastern Kharkiv regions that it has occupied, totaling ~170 square miles. Sources said Putin also sought formal recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. He also wants Ukraine to be barred from joining NATO, but he'd be open to the nation receiving some kind of security guarantees. Zelenskyy, along with the leaders of the European Union, NATO, UK, Germany, France and Italy, will meet Trump at the White House this week to map out a peace deal. "President Zelenskyy can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight," Trump posted on Truth Social. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!" "We all equally want to end this war quickly and reliably," Zelenskyy said ahead of the meeting. Found a factual error?

A startling contrast to the inaction by biden over the past four years.

Allowing Putin to benefit in any way from his illegal invasion of Ukraine and numerous war crimes including kidnapping thousands of Ukrainian children is unacceptable. Russia, the US and the UK are all signatories to the Budapest accords that guarantee Ukraine's security and territorial integrity in return for Ukraine removing nuclear weapons from their country. Putin didn't honor this agreement. Why does anyone think that he will honor a new one?

Ukrainians give up to an illegal invasion that would take their country away because they might lose? Lucky you werenâ€™t a US soldier in 1775 and forward. Reply Like (1) darnoc111 19 Aug. 2025, 1:08 PM Premium Investing Group Comments (10.04K) | + Follow @MWB3 My point is that when you are dead do you really care who won? That is the reason I asked if they were going to put up the lives of themselves and their family. And with so many having been killed or wounded on the Ukrainian side does it make sense to continue? Here is a slightly different example of what I am talking " "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield" from Star Trek: The Original Series" It is racism but the results are the same with eventual annihilation of both races.

He also knows Ukraine is now capable of building g its own long range missiles, able to strike deep inside Russia without outside political interference. Neither Putin nor Krasnov can be trusted. They plot together to reward Putin for stealing and murder. Absent Krasnovâ€™s intervention, Putin can lose in this (unfair) fight. His people are dissatisfied as the Russian economy crumbles. Putin can end the war today by retreating to within his own borders. In that case he need not fear NATO. With 1,000,000+ casualties and his cratered economy, he is too committed, cornered into pushing forward. American traitor, delivering our ally to the enemy. General Patton is rolling over in his grave.

He's doing whatever he wants even with Trump as President. We can't trust Putin to do anything he agrees to and considers Trump a ful means to an end because what he fears most are Democracies and loves that Trump is trying to destroying ours and is doing the dirty work for him. He couldn't ask for a better inside guy... Reply Like (3) Mike Nadel 19 Aug. 2025, 12:03 PM Analyst Premium Investing Group Comments (42.76K) | + Follow @mhfnet Yup. In 1938, Hitler demanded Sudetenland, a part of Czechoslovakia where ethnic Germans made up a significant percentage of the population. The British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, negotiated the surrender of the land, without involving Czechoslovakia. The higher purpose of those negotiations was security and peace for the rest of Europe. Less than a year after Czechoslovakia was forced to cede Sudetenland, however, Hitler invaded Poland and World War II began. That was the last war of aggression on the European continent until Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022. Putin is a war criminal who often takes cues from history. To those who believe he will stop at Ukraine, Putin has a bridge in Sudetenland to sell them.

Seriously, it just depends on who's doing the polling. Yes, insider advantage says 54%. Reuters says 40%, and a bunch of others are all in the 40s. I go to real clear politics to see poll results.
