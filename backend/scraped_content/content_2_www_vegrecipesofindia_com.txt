Jump to Recipe Aloo Bhindi is a hearty North Indian dish made by stir-frying tender okra (bhindi) and cubed potatoes (aloo) with onions, tomato, ginger-garlic paste and a blend of spices. This flavorful dry dish features crispy golden potatoes, perfectly tender okra in a sautéed onion-tomato base. It is a popular accompaniment to roti or rice in Punjabi households, offering a delicious combination of earthy flavors and textures. Aloo Bhindi Sometimes, a simple, comforting Bhindi Recipe is all that you need with your dal-chawal to make a beautifully wholesome, tasty and filling meal on a lazy afternoon. This Aloo Bhindi recipe is just that, in fact more. It is a delicious lightly spiced dry curry made with okra or bhindi, potatoes (aloo) and spices in an onion-tomato masala mixture. This dish is also vegan and pairs very well with roti, naan or paratha too. Since both potatoes (aloo in Hindi) and okra or lady’s finger (bhindi in Hindi) are the star ingredients in this ly recipe, the dish is rightly named as Aloo Bhindi. Made in North Indian, rather Punjabi style, both the bhindi and aloo are sautéed or fried in oil in this recipe. This cooking method makes sure that the okra does not become slimy and the potatoes do not crumble in the final Aloo Bhindi dish. Also, as raw okra and potatoes are not directly added while cooking this dish, it ensures that the okra does not become too soft or mushy. Thus, the final dish has a good texture and looks great and appetizing on the dinner table. This recipe of Aloo Bhindi is also super easy and uses all the basic ingredients that are a part of North Indian or Punjabi cooking. So, you actually don’t have to get tensed in sourcing any of these as all of them, more or less, will be available in your kitchen. Along with okra and potatoes, this Aloo Bhindi recipe uses basic ingredients like onion, tomato, ginger-garlic paste, and a few spices. I also add hing (asafoetida), kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), and amchur (dry mango powder) for extra flavor and tang. The spice mix includes cumin, coriander, turmeric, and red chilli powder — or you can use paprika or cayenne as a substitute. And you can use any neutral flavored oil to cook this dish. For a gluten-free version, skip the asafoetida. Recipe Highlights I always prefer using okra that is fresh and tender. Avoid using okra that has become mature or stringy for this recipe of Aloo Bhindi. Once you rinse the okra, dry it thoroughly with a kitchen towel before chopping. Never chop wet okra as this will make the sabzi slimy. If you prefer, you can even steam or boil the potatoes instead of frying them. But do not steam or boil the okra. They need to be sautéed or pan-fried. Some people make Aloo Bhindi with a gravy or sauce. But at my place, we always make it a semi-dry preparation mostly for breakfast, brunch or lunch. The benefit of making this Aloo Bhindi for breakfast is that it can be packed in the tiffin box with some roti/chapati or parathas. The recipe is a non-fussy one and bit spicy too. If you want to make it for kids, then you can slightly reduce the red chili powder and ginger-garlic paste in it. Love bhindi? You might also enjoy these flavorful variations: Bhindi Masala – a semi-dry, tangy curry with onions and tomatoes. Bharwa Bhindi – tender okra filled with a spiced masala mix. Kurkuri Bhindi – crispy, fried okra that’s perfect as a snack or side. How to make Aloo Bhindi Fry Potatoes and Okra 1. Make smaller pieces or cubes as they will be quick to fry. In a kadai or pan, heat 3 to 4 tablespoons oil. Once the oil becomes medium hot, add the potatoes and fry them till opaque, change color, turn crisp and are cooked completely. In between, stir the potatoes with a slotted spoon. Tip: You can use any neutral flavored oil. I generally use either peanut oil or sunflower oil. Once the potato cubes look crispy and are light golden or golden and tender, remove then with a slotted spoon – draining as much oil as you can. Place the fried potatoes on a kitchen paper towel. In the same oil, add 200 to 250 grams of chopped okra (bhindi) and sauté until fully cooked and tender. You can check if it’s done by inserting a knife—if it goes through easily, the okra is cooked. I suggest chopping the okra into 1 to 1.25-inch pieces for this recipe. Place the fried okra on a kitchen paper towel to remove excess oil. In the same oil, add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions (1 medium-sized onion). Sauté, stirring at intervals, until translucent or light brown. Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and sauté for some seconds or till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic goes away. Next, add 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes (2 medium-sized tomatoes). Sauté, stirring at intervals, till soft and pulpy. Next, add all the spice powders, except garam masala powder and dried mango powder (amchur powder): ½ teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin) 1 teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander) ¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper or paprika ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric) 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) – optional. Skip adding it if you want to make the dish gluten-free or use a gluten-free asafoetida. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes or until the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala mixture. Add the fried potatoes and sautéed okra. Stir gently until the whole masala mixture coats both the potatoes and okra. Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder, ¼ to ½ teaspoon dried mango powder and salt as required. Mix very well and sauté for a minute. Lastly, add ¼ teaspoon crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and sauté for a minute more. Note: If you do not have dried mango powder, add ¼ to ½ teaspoon lemon juice. Omit the dried fenugreek leaves too, if you do not have it. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve Aloo Bhindi hot or warm. Serving Suggestions With Indian flatbre: Aloo Bhindi tastes the best with Indian flatbre like Roti , Paratha or Naan. Sides to serve: You can also team up some plain Curd (yogurt) or a simple raita ( Cucumber Raita or Onion Raita ) along with it. A simple Kachumber Salad also works well. In the above photo, I have paired with Vegetable Raita. As a side dish: You can serve this Bhindi Aloo as a side dish with Khichdi , Dal Fry , Punjabi Kadhi or with any other Indian curry or lentil dish paired with steamed rice. Lunch box: You can pack Aloo Bhindi with some chapati or paratha for lunch box. Storage Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. To reheat, warm it in a pan on low heat or use a microwave. Add a splash of water if it feels too dry and mix evenly to combine. Expert Tips Buying okra: Always buy okra pods that are fresh, tender and young. Avoid buying okra that is stringy or mature. Prepping okra: After rinsing the okra, always dry thoroughly with a kitchen towel before chopping. You can spread the okra on a large plate or tray and let it dry naturally. Remember not to chop wet okra as this will make it slimy. Cooking potatoes: If you prefer, you can also steam or boil the potatoes and then include in the recipe. Remember that the steamed or boiled potatoes will give a different texture and taste to the recipe. Choice of fat: This dish can be prepared with any neutral flavored oil or even ghee (clarified butter). I personally prefer making it with sunflower or peanut oil. Spices: When making for small kids, then add less ginger-garlic paste, garam masala powder and red chili powder. Gluten-free variation: To make the dish gluten free, omit adding asafoetida or use a gluten-free asafoetida. Scaling: The recipe of Aloo Bhindi can easily be scaled to make a larger batch. What are the ingredients in Aloo Bhindi? The classic Aloo Bhindi includes okra (bhindi), potatoes (aloo), onions, tomatoes, and spices like turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and sometimes garam masala or dry mango powder (amchur) for tang. In my version, I sauté the okra first to reduce sliminess, fry the potatoes separately, and then mix both with a sautéed mix of onions, tomatoes, ginger-garlic paste, and a balanced blend of spices including amchur. This brings out a style flavor that’s simple yet delicious. Can I skip onions and garlic in this recipe? Yes, for a satvik version, simply omit onions and garlic. The spices, tomatoes, and ginger will still give plenty of flavor. Can I use boiled potatoes instead of raw? Yes, you can use boiled potatoes for a quicker version. Just add them with the sautéed bhindi.

Lunch box: You can pack aloo bhindi and some roti for lunch box. Notes Make sure to dry the okra pods thoroughly after rinsing. Okra pods with any water droplets on them will become sticky and slimy while chopping and cooking. Use okra pods that are green, fresh and tender. For a gluten-free version skip adding the asafoetida or use gluten-free asafoetida. When making for small kids, you could reduce the amounts of ginger-garlic paste, garam masala powder and red chili powder. The potatoes can be steamed or boiled instead. But make a note that the soft texture of steamed or boiled potatoes will give a different flavor and taste. This recipe can be doubled or tripled.

I have every essential ingredient for this recipe except the dry mango powder. There are plenty of mangos here…. but there are no supermarkets here like in the USA. It is fresh open markets with local produce. What would you suggest that I use in place of dry mango powder? Reply skip the dry mango powder. and just add a bit of lime or lemon juice after you are finished cooking. if you can get dried pomegranate seeds, then you can lightly roast them and crush in a mortar-pestle and add.

Reply Hi Dassana, This was the first time i tried my hand at cooking.. You have illustrated it very well. Makes it even more easy for beginners like me. My Aloo Bhindi dish was a great hit amongst family and colleagues! Looking for more of your recipes.. Also can you please suggest any recipes for Soya? Reply welcome krutika and thanks for this positive feedback. i don’t use soya for health reasons. Reply I followed these tips and made awesome non sticky bhindi. The first time I have ever done it without regretting buying the bhindi so wanted to share with my fellow bhindi lovers. Warning: it is a little involved but turns out great results. Chop bhindi however(mine was in rounds). You can skip this step, if you wash bhindi, wait for couple hours and chop. I wanted to make certain mine was totally dry before chopping. Non sticks shouldnt be heated higher than med, else they get ruined. Fry until slightly brownish green, unless you really love deep fried bhindi sabji. When all bhindies are fried, use remaining oil for sabji. Don’t add any water to sabji or cover at all. Both will introduce moisture to the dish, which you are trying to avoid. If your sabji is too dry, or you think it will burn, you can reduce heat and add oil by 1/2 tsps. When sabji masala is done, take pan off fire, then add bhindies and mix well. Let this sabji cool before covering.
