An invasion of Ukraine? Is this a prelude to war? Like most foreign journalists in Moscow, I have a tele number for the Kremlin press office. What I don't have is a direct line into the mind of Vladimir Putin. Only he, perhaps, knows what the plan is and, right now, at and abroad, he's keeping everyone guessing. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What would be the fallout if Russia invaded Ukraine? But some things are clear. This week marks 30 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. President Putin once described that as \"the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th Century.\" He remains deeply resentful of how the Cold War ended: with Moscow losing territory, influence and empire. \"What was the break-up of the USSR? It was the break-up of historical Russia,\" Mr Putin said in a recent state TV documentary. \"We lost 40% of our territory… much of what had been accumulated over 1,000 years was lost.\" The Kremlin resents, too, Nato's post-Cold War enlargement to the east. Moscow accuses the West of breaking verbal promises that the alliance would not expand into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet space. Nato insists no such promises were given. Can Russia undo what is done? It appears to be trying. 2:57 Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line (last month) Last week, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov unveiled draft security agreements that Moscow wants America to sign. They would provide a legally binding guarantee that Nato will give up military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine. The proposals would appear to prohibit Nato deployments to countries that joined the alliance after 1997. Russia is also demanding an end to Nato enlargement in former Soviet territory. In an online briefing, I suggested to Mr Ryabkov that what Russia is proposing is a \"complete reassessment of the results of the Cold War\". \"I wouldn't call it a re-examination of the results of the Cold War,\" he replied. \"I would say we're re-evaluating the expansion the West has carried out in recent years against Russian interests. This has been done in different ways, using various resources, with hostile intent. Enough is enough.\" Nato - a defensive alliance - denies it has any \"hostile intent\" towards Russia. As for \"enough is enough\", Western governments say just that the Kremlin's behaviour. Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its military intervention in eastern Ukraine triggered Western sanctions and an image of Vladimir Putin's Russia as an aggressor. It is why the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine is causing such concern. Tass/Getty Images If Ukraine ever joins Nato or if Nato develops military infrastructure there, we will hold a gun to America's head. We have the military capability What happens if Russia fails to receive the security guarantees it is demanding? \"We'll deploy missiles. We don't want this,\" says Dmitry Kiselev, who presents the most popular news show on Russian state TV and plays a key role in spreading the Kremlin's message to the public. Mr Kiselev, who is under Western sanctions, also he the giant state media holding Rossiya Segodnya. \"If Ukraine ever joins Nato or if Nato develops military infrastructure there, we will hold a gun to America's head. We have the military capability. \"Russia has the best weapons in the world - hypersonic ones. They'd reach America as fast as US or British weapons could reach Moscow from Ukraine. It would be the Cuban missile crisis all over again, but with a shorter flight time for the missiles.\" \"Is Russia prepared to use force to defend its red lines?\" I ask Mr Kiselev. \"One hundred percent, because for Russia this is a question of life or death.\" \"But Russia is dictating to its neighbours,\" I continue. \"You're saying that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Moldova, all former Soviet republics can't have anything to do with Nato?\" \"Countries are either lucky or they're unlucky to be next to Russia. It's either lucky or not to be close to America,\" Mr Kiselev says. \"It would be good to harmonise our interests and not put Russia in a position where missiles could reach us in four minutes,\" he adds. \"Russia is ready to create a comparable, analogous threat, by deploying its weapons close to decision-making centres. But we are suggesting a way of avoiding this, of not creating threats. Otherwise, everyone will be turned into radioactive ash.\" Can a solution be found for war in Ukraine's east? What next for Ukraine after Putin-Biden talks? So, is the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine coercive diplomacy? Is the Kremlin's aim to extract concessions and security guarantees from Washington without the need for war? If so, it is a high-stakes approach. \"There is a real danger of an inadvertent escalation, be it in the Donbas, along the Russian-Ukrainian border, or maybe in the Black Sea,\" says Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank linked to the Russian authorities. \"If you have tensions, if you have this very poisonous political atmosphere, if you have a lot of military activities, on the ground, in the air, the sea, there are risks something goes wrong. This could lead to a conflict no-one really wants.\" And if there is a major conflict? The annexation of Crimea proved popular with the Russian public. But Russians have little appetite for a full-scale war with Ukraine or military confrontation with the West. \"I don't think that Russians are focused now on foreign policy success stories, real or imaginary,\" says Mr Kortunov. \"The agenda is mostly domestic and the real concerns of Russians are connected to social and economic problems. I don't think Putin is in a position to get a couple of additional points if he starts an operation abroad.\" Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

Share Expert Brief CFR scholars provide expert analysis and commentary on international issues. to receive CFR President Mike Froman’s analysis on the most important foreign policy story of the week, delivered to your inbox every Friday. More From Our Experts Stephen Sestanovich Echoes of Reykjavik: What Trump Can Learn From a Failed Summit Liana Fix What to Expect From the Trump-Putin Alaska Summit Max Boot Trump’s Iran Attack Was Impressive, but Airpower Has Its Limits More than two years after he launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to insist that all his goals will be achieved. He has not, however, spelled them out in great detail, leaving himself considerable wiggle room to declare victory depending on battlefield developments. Broadly speaking, his goals fall into three baskets: weakening or disrupting Ukraine’s ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) , stymieing Ukrainian nationalism, and expanding territorial gains. More on: Ukraine Russia Vladimir Putin NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Military Operations Understanding Putin’s goals and motivations is a critical element in developing a counterstrategy to ensure that he does not succeed. His security concerns leading up to the war could have been dealt with through intense negotiations with Ukraine and the West, which were underway but then overtaken by his decision to launch the invasion in 2022. Putin has no right to impose on Ukraine his views of how it should structure its military or run its internal affairs. Any concerns could have been a topic for diplomacy, and perhaps negotiation, with Ukraine’s leaders, but no more. And it goes without saying, invading another country and seizing territory is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter and the norms of European security. Dealing With NATO Ties From the outset, Putin has embedded his issues regarding Ukraine in the larger question of NATO’s role in Europe. He has long railed against the alliance’s expansion and potential Ukrainian membership as a grave threat to Russia’s security, as well as a betrayal of promises at the end of the Cold War not to extend NATO “an inch” eastward. Russian draft treaties on security guarantees released in the run-up to the invasion focused on NATO, not Ukraine. The three key demands in these treaties were an end to NATO expansion, a prohibition on the deployment of offensive weapons along Russia’s borders, and the withdrawal of NATO infrastructure back to the lines of 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed two years before the first post-Cold War wave of expansion.

What unsettled Putin was the ever-closer military and security cooperation between Ukraine and individual NATO members, especially the United States, which included more frequent and complex joint exercises in and around Ukraine. As before, Putin—like the rest of the Russian elite—was vehemently opposed to Ukraine’s membership. In his view, NATO was now deliberately working to make Ukraine into a staging ground for lightning strikes against Russia. NATO’s insistence that it was a defensive alliance predictably fell on deaf ears in the Kremlin. Tellingly, in major es leading up to the invasion, Putin ranted the West’s threat to Russia and insidious role in turning Ukraine into an “anti-Russia.” More From Our Experts Stephen Sestanovich Echoes of Reykjavik: What Trump Can Learn From a Failed Summit Liana Fix What to Expect From the Trump-Putin Alaska Summit Max Boot Trump’s Iran Attack Was Impressive, but Airpower Has Its Limits Quelling Nationalism Putin’s concerns NATO overlapped with the two goals he identified as essential to Russia’s security when he launched the “special military operation”: the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. A hint of the content of those two processes came in the negotiations Russian and Ukrainian officials held in the first weeks after the invasion in an effort to produce a framework for a settlement. With regard to demilitarization, the Russians insisted on Ukrainian neutrality, while proposing a peacetime military force capped at eighty-five thousand troops, as well as strict limits on heavy weaponry and the range of missile systems. As for denazification, Moscow wanted Kyiv to ban neo-Nazism and aggressive nationalism and to repeal laws that advanced a view of Soviet-era history that ran counter to the Kremlin-approved version. In particular, the Russians were opposed to any positive mention of the role Ukrainian nationalists might have played in World War II—they consider those forces to be Nazi sympathizers, if not outright Nazis, and honoring them to be evidence of neo-Nazi attitudes, even though the far right has little in Ukraine. Left unsaid is what many observers considered Putin’s real goal: the overthrow of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who he smeared as neo-Nazi, and the ation of a puppet regime. He fervently believes that Russians and Ukrainians are one people , and that Ukraine can thrive only in partnership with Russia. He has spoken his desire to recover Russia’s “historical lands” without specifying what they are, although they clearly include at least parts of Ukraine. Russia already effectively controlled two pieces of Ukrainian territory prior to its 2022 invasion, which it had seized at a time of upheaval in Ukraine in 2014: Crimea, which it had illegally annexed, and parts of two provinces in the eastern Donbas region, where it had ed pro-Russian separatist leaders. Nevertheless, when Putin announced the “special military operation,” he suggested that he had little interest in seizing much territory. He declared his intention to be protecting the Russian-speaking population of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, which Russia had recognized as independent states just three days earlier. Presumably, that goal entailed “liberating” the territory of those republics that Kyiv still controlled. Beyond that, Putin claimed that his plans did not include the occupation of “Ukrainian lands.” What he meant by that is ambiguous. Putin firmly believes that today’s Ukraine was the creation of the Soviet-era leader Vladimir Lenin and his Bolshevik comrades, who gave it some of Russia’s “historical lands.” The only region of Ukraine that clearly does not fit in that category is historical Galicia, land in the west that Ukraine gained as a consequence of the Soviet victory in World War II. In any event, the main lines of advance during the invasion have suggested Putin had far greater territorial ambitions. Arguably, the thrust toward Kyiv could be construed as part of an operation to “denazify” Ukraine by seizing the capital and overthrowing the government, which Putin had branded as neo-Nazi. But the march on Kharkiv in the east, the drive to create a land bridge between Crimea and Donbas, and the thrust toward Odesa all looked like part of an ambitious plan to control all of Ukraine east of the Dnipro River, which bifurcates the country, or the territory of what was once known as Novorossiya, roughly the land Catherine the Great had seized from Turkey in the mid-eighteenth century. If successful, Russia would have then fully controlled the Sea of Azov and the entire north shore of the Black Sea, turning a rump Ukraine into a landlocked country. Lack of success on the battlefield in the early stages of the war compelled Putin to adjust his immediate goals. Stymied in the effort to seize Kharkiv and Odesa and concerned further Ukrainian advances eastward in the fall of 2022, Putin annexed the four provinces his troops partially controlled on the basis of sham referenda. Those provinces thus marked the minimal gains that would satisfy Putin. All Russian offers of negotiations since then have stipulated that Ukraine would have to accept the existing “geopolitical realities” —that is, an acknowledgment that the annexed territories are indeed Russia’s. Putin believes that he can still achieve all the goals he has set for his military operation. His confidence is only growing with Russia’s recent gains on the battlefield near Kharkiv, which are shifting momentum in his favor. Nevertheless, ultimate success is far from certain. Ukraine’s ties with NATO are growing stronger. Zelenskyy’s government has survived, as has Ukraine as an independent state. What little progress Russia has made on the battlefield has come at horrific cost in men and armaments. But Putin is not prepared to relent in the effort to achieve his goals. It is the task of Ukraine and the West to ensure that he does not succeed. Will Merrow and Michael Bricknell created the graphics for this article.

Ukraine and its European allies don’t believe he does, while the Russian leader himself said he wants peace but then refused to to it when presented with the option. What Putin really wants, though, is much, much bigger. The Russian president has made no secret of the fact that he believes Ukraine should not exist as an independent state and he has repeatedly said he wants NATO to shrink back to its Cold War-era size. Ad Feedback But more than anything, he wants to see a new global order — and he wants Russia to play the starring role in it.

They have never forgotten the humiliation of the fall of the Soviet Union and are not happy with the way the world has turned out since then. Putin rose to power during the chaos of the 1990s, when the Russian economy collapsed and had to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – another humiliation for the former superpower. Ad Feedback But from 2000, when Putin became president, steadily rising oil prices made Russia and many Russians richer than ever before. It was invited into the G7 group of the world’s largest economies – renamed the G8 after it joined. But this was not enough for the Russian leader, Kristine Berzina, a managing director at the German Marshal Fund of United States, told CNN. “Putin was happy to throw all that away on behalf of his citizens because of higher geopolitical aims,” Berzina said. Russia was expelled from the G8, sanctioned by the West and ostracized on the global stage because of its aggression against Ukraine. Berzina said it was never good enough for Russia to be “the eighth in the G7.” “That doesn’t work within Russia’s understanding of its own exceptionalism. It is the largest country in the world, the richest in (natural) resources, so how can it simply be one of the players?” she said. A convoy of Russian troops moves along a road in the occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol on April 21, 2022. Chingis Kondarov/Reuters To understand what Putin wants from the current talks with the US, it’s key to remember that the two sides are talking because the United States made a policy U-turn under Trump — not because of a fundamental change in Russian thinking. Trump wants the war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible, even if it means further territorial losses for Ukraine. This means Putin has little to lose from talking. Trump has claimed that “Russia holds all the cards” in the war with Ukraine, but the battlefield has been mostly stalled for the past two years. While Russia is making some incremental gains, it is definitely not winning – though this could change if the US was to stop supplying arms and intelligence to Ukraine. “Putin went into Ukraine thinking that it will be an easy, quick operation. Three years on, he controls 20% of Ukraine, but at terrible, terrible cost. I mean, essentially the Russians are losing. The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,” leading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti told CNN. For Putin and the people around him, Trump’s push for a ceasefire simply presents an opportunity to secure quick wins while keeping an eye on the long-term goals, he said. He likes creating dynamic, chaotic situations, which throw up a whole variety of opportunities. And then he can then just pick which opportunity appeals to him, and he can change his mind,” Galeotti said. Long term plan Putin and his aides have made it very clear that their long-term goals have not changed. Even as they talk wanting peace, Russian officials have continued to insist that the “root causes” of the conflict in Ukraine must be “eliminated.” In the Kremlin’s view, these “root causes” amount to Ukraine’s sovereignty and its democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as NATO’s expansion to the east in the past 30 years.

His goal was to turn Ukraine into a vassal state like Belarus and prevent it from joining the European Union and NATO in the future. He has not achieved that goal by using military force, but that doesn’t mean he has abandoned it. Instead, he might try to achieve it by other means. “The easiest way for Russia to attain what it wants in a different country is not through military means, but through interference and electoral process,” Berzina said, adding that it is possible – even likely – that this is what Moscow would try to do after a ceasefire was in place. This is likely why Russia keeps questioning Zelensky’s legitimacy and pushing for an election – and why Kremlin was delighted when Trump adopted this narrative and called the Ukrainian leader “a dictator without elections.” Ukraine’s martial law – imposed because of Russia’s aggression – prohibits elections from taking place while the conflict is ongoing. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have rejected the idea that Ukraine could join NATO any time soon and Putin has asked for a US commitment that this will not happen to be part of any ceasefire agreement.

Alex Babenko/AP But Berzina said that Ukraine’s European allies are not buying Putin’s promises that he would stop fighting if Ukraine became – as he called it – neutral. “No matter what Trump and Putin think they can arrange this week or this year, many people in Europe now find Putin fundamentally untrustworthy,” she said. “Could there be a desire for Russia to try its hand again militarily? Sure. And that is why the Europeans are very clear-eyed on the potential for future military engagement.” It’s all personal Andrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist and security expert who lives in exile in London, said Putin and his aides believe they can “try to get something out of Trump right now.” “They think they can win some tactical battles but that he would not give them what they really want, which is a complete rearrangement of security arrangements in Europe,” he said.

Russia’s wariness of the US goes far back. “It’s very personal to them because they were all young KGB officers back then, and they lost their social standing, they lost a place in Russian society, they lost the country as they describe it now, and it was extremely humiliating,” Soldatov said. “They really believe that the West has been after the complete destruction and subjugation of Russia for centuries. It’s not just propaganda, they really, really believe in this.” But Putin has also framed his plan for Ukraine within his own – inaccurate — interpretation of history, which goes well beyond the fall of the Soviet Union. Putin has often argued that Ukraine is not a real country because Ukraine and Ukrainians are part of a larger “historical Russia” Experts say this is, of course, nonsense. “What he’s talking is the fact that Russia and Ukraine and Belarus share a political ancestor called Rus … but it’s very much not the same thing as any modern country. It was an early to late medieval political entity and to say that Ukraine doesn’t have a right to exist because of this shared ancestor — no country looks the same as in the 10th century,” said Monica White, an associate professor in Russian and Slavonic Studies at the University of Nottingham. Putin has also often turned to Russia’s religious identity in of his plan. The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is one of the loudest ers of the war. Putin and Orthodox Patriarch Kirill visit the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg on September 12, 2024. Alexander Kazakov/AFP/Getty Images “After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia lost its connection with the ancestral Orthodox lands and I think part of Putin’s project is to try to bring back that thread connecting 10th century Rus with this pure orthodox continuity,” White said. “What he’s doing is actually not so different from some of the early Romanov Tzars who kept trying to get back the Orthodox lands that were under either Ottoman or Catholic rule, and they eventually did.” Putin’s overwhelming desire is to return Russia to the global stage with a bang, she suggests – by creating a wedge between Europe and the US and teaming up with the West’s other adversaries. “Russia wants to be at all the important tables – so whatever comes next, maybe it doesn’t have to mean territorial conquest in Europe, but I think it does have to be in a starring role in the more powerful bloc, if it sees that to include China or Iran or others, a bloc that is defined by its willingness to disrupt and destabilize,” White added. Putin clearly believes that Russia – the largest country in the world by area – should be involved in running the world. He might have a like-minded man in the White House. Trump has made it clear that he believes the biggest and most powerful countries should get what they want – whether it’s Greenland, the Panama Canal, or a chunk of Ukraine. “I think that the fundamental point is that, as far as Trump is concerned, Ukraine is a bought and paid for vassal state and has to understand its place and accept that, essentially, America will work out some kind of a deal with Russia and then bring it back to Ukraine,” Galeotti said.

    "content": "5 Share Save Play ( 2min ) Comments (605) Andrew Harnik/Getty Images News As Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders head to Washington on Monday, details have emerged of the offer that Russia's Vladimir Putin put forward during his summit with Donald Trump in Alaska. Under Putin's proposal, Kyiv would cede swathes of its eastern land that Russia has been unable to capture, sources briefed on Moscow's thinking told Reuters. This would involve Kyiv fully withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk, which make up the eastern Donbas region that's rich in coal and critical minerals. Russia currently controls almost all of Luhansk and 70% of Donetsk. In return, Russia would pledge to freeze the front lines in the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. It would return smaller pockets of Ukraine's northern Sumy and northeastern Kharkiv regions that it has occupied, totaling ~170 square miles. Sources said Putin also sought formal recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. He also wants Ukraine to be barred from joining NATO, but he'd be open to the nation receiving some kind of security guarantees. Zelenskyy, along with the leaders of the European Union, NATO, UK, Germany, France and Italy, will meet Trump at the White House this week to map out a peace deal. \"President Zelenskyy can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.

He also knows Ukraine is now capable of building g its own long range missiles, able to strike deep inside Russia without outside political interference. Neither Putin nor Krasnov can be trusted. They plot together to reward Putin for stealing and murder. Absent Krasnov’s intervention, Putin can lose in this (unfair) fight. His people are dissatisfied as the Russian economy crumbles. Putin can end the war today by retreating to within his own borders. In that case he need not fear NATO. With 1,000,000+ casualties and his cratered economy, he is too committed, cornered into pushing forward. American traitor, delivering our ally to the enemy.

In 1938, Hitler demanded Sudetenland, a part of Czechoslovakia where ethnic Germans made up a significant percentage of the population. The British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, negotiated the surrender of the land, without involving Czechoslovakia. The higher purpose of those negotiations was security and peace for the rest of Europe. Less than a year after Czechoslovakia was forced to cede Sudetenland, however, Hitler invaded Poland and World War II began. That was the last war of aggression on the European continent until Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022. Putin is a war criminal who often takes cues from history. To those who believe he will stop at Ukraine, Putin has a bridge in Sudetenland to sell them.

The account emerged the day after Trump and Putin met at an airforce base in Alaska, the first encounter between a U.S. president and the Kremlin chief since before the start of the Ukraine conflict. The Reuters Daily Briefing provides all the news you need to start your day. · Scroll to continue Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to travel to Washington on Monday to discuss with Trump a possible settlement of the full-scale war, which Putin launched in February 2022. Although the summit failed to secure the ceasefire he said he had wanted, Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity that he and Putin had discussed land transfers and security guarantees for Ukraine, and had \"largely agreed\". \"I think we're pretty close to a deal,\" he said, adding: \"Ukraine has to agree to it. Maybe they'll say 'no'.\" The two sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said their knowledge of Putin's proposals was mostly based on discussions between leaders in Europe, the U.S. and Ukraine, and noted it was not complete. · Scroll to continue Trump briefed Zelenskiy and European leaders on his summit discussions early on Saturday. It was not immediately clear if the proposals by Putin were an opening gambit to serve as a starting point for negotiations or more like a final offer that was not subject to discussion. UKRAINIAN LAND FOR PEACE At face value, at least some of the demands would present huge challenges for Ukraine's leadership to accept. Putin's offer ruled out a ceasefire until a comprehensive deal is reached, blocking a key demand of Zelenskiy, whose country is hit daily by Russian drones and ballistic missiles. Under the proposed Russian deal, Kyiv would fully withdraw from the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in return for a Russian pledge to freeze the front lines in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the sources said. Ukraine has already rejected any retreat from Ukrainian land such as the Donetsk region, where its troops are dug in and which Kyiv says serves as a crucial defensive structure to prevent Russian attacks deeper into its territory. Item 1 of 5 Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump pose on a podium on the tarmac after they arrived to attend a meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S., August 15, 2025. Sputnik/Gavriil Grigorov/Pool via REUTERS Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. Sputnik/Gavriil Grigorov/Pool via REUTERS Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Russia would be prepared to return comparatively small tracts of Ukrainian land it has occupied in the northern Sumy and northeastern Kharkiv regions, the sources said. Russia holds pockets of the Sumy and Kharkiv regions that total around 440 square km, according to Ukraine's Deep State battlefield mapping project. Ukraine controls around 6,600 square km of Donbas , which comprises the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and is claimed by Russia. Although the Americans have not spelled this out, the sources said they knew Russia's leader was also seeking - at the very least - formal recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. It was not clear if that meant recognition by the U.S. government or, for instance, all Western powers and Ukraine. Kyiv and its European allies reject formal recognition of Moscow's rule in the peninsula. They said Putin would also expect the lifting of at least some of the array of sanctions on Russia. However, they could not say if this applied to U.S. Trump said on Friday he did not immediately need to consider retaliatory tariffs on countries such as China for buying Russian oil - which is subject to a range of Western sanctions - but might have to \"in two or three weeks.\" Ukraine would also be barred from joining the NATO military alliance, though Putin seemed to be open to Ukraine receiving some kind of security guarantees, the sources said. However, they added that it was unclear what this meant in practice. European leaders said Trump had discussed security guarantees for Ukraine during their conversation on Saturday and also broached an idea for an \"Article 5\"-style guarantee outside the NATO military alliance. NATO regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article 5 clause. Joining the Atlantic alliance is a strategic objective for Kyiv that is enshrined in the country's constitution. Russia would also demand official status for the Russian language inside parts of, or across, Ukraine, as well as the right of the Russian Orthodox Church to operate freely, the sources said. Ukraine's security agency accuses the Moscow-linked church of abetting Russia's war on Ukraine by spreading pro-Russian propaganda and housing spies, something denied by the church which says it has cut canonical ties with Moscow. Ukraine has passed a law banning Russia-linked religious organisations, of which it considers the church to be one. However, it has not yet started enforcing the ban.
