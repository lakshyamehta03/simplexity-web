    "content": "Jump to Recipe Aloo Bhindi is a hearty North Indian dish made by stir-frying tender okra (bhindi) and cubed potatoes (aloo) with onions, tomato, ginger-garlic paste and a blend of spices. This flavorful dry dish features crispy golden potatoes, perfectly tender okra in a sautéed onion-tomato base. It is a popular accompaniment to roti or rice in Punjabi households, offering a delicious combination of earthy flavors and textures. Aloo Bhindi Sometimes, a simple, comforting Bhindi Recipe is all that you need with your dal-chawal to make a beautifully wholesome, tasty and filling meal on a lazy afternoon. This Aloo Bhindi recipe is just that, in fact more. It is a delicious lightly spiced dry curry made with okra or bhindi, potatoes (aloo) and spices in an onion-tomato masala mixture. This dish is also vegan and pairs very well with roti, naan or paratha too. Since both potatoes (aloo in Hindi) and okra or lady’s finger (bhindi in Hindi) are the star ingredients in this ly recipe, the dish is rightly named as Aloo Bhindi. Made in North Indian, rather Punjabi style, both the bhindi and aloo are sautéed or fried in oil in this recipe. This cooking method makes sure that the okra does not become slimy and the potatoes do not crumble in the final Aloo Bhindi dish. Also, as raw okra and potatoes are not directly added while cooking this dish, it ensures that the okra does not become too soft or mushy. Thus, the final dish has a good texture and looks great and appetizing on the dinner table. This recipe of Aloo Bhindi is also super easy and uses all the basic ingredients that are a part of North Indian or Punjabi cooking. So, you actually don’t have to get tensed in sourcing any of these as all of them, more or less, will be available in your kitchen. Along with okra and potatoes, this Aloo Bhindi recipe uses basic ingredients like onion, tomato, ginger-garlic paste, and a few spices. I also add hing (asafoetida), kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), and amchur (dry mango powder) for extra flavor and tang. The spice mix includes cumin, coriander, turmeric, and red chilli powder — or you can use paprika or cayenne as a substitute. And you can use any neutral flavored oil to cook this dish. For a gluten-free version, skip the asafoetida. Recipe Highlights I always prefer using okra that is fresh and tender. Avoid using okra that has become mature or stringy for this recipe of Aloo Bhindi. Once you rinse the okra, dry it thoroughly with a kitchen towel before chopping. Never chop wet okra as this will make the sabzi slimy. If you prefer, you can even steam or boil the potatoes instead of frying them. But do not steam or boil the okra. They need to be sautéed or pan-fried. Some people make Aloo Bhindi with a gravy or sauce. But at my place, we always make it a semi-dry preparation mostly for breakfast, brunch or lunch. The benefit of making this Aloo Bhindi for breakfast is that it can be packed in the tiffin box with some roti/chapati or parathas. The recipe is a non-fussy one and bit spicy too. If you want to make it for kids, then you can slightly reduce the red chili powder and ginger-garlic paste in it. Love bhindi? You might also enjoy these flavorful variations: Bhindi Masala – a semi-dry, tangy curry with onions and tomatoes. Bharwa Bhindi – tender okra filled with a spiced masala mix. Kurkuri Bhindi – crispy, fried okra that’s perfect as a snack or side. How to make Aloo Bhindi Fry Potatoes and Okra 1. Make smaller pieces or cubes as they will be quick to fry. In a kadai or pan, heat 3 to 4 tablespoons oil. Once the oil becomes medium hot, add the potatoes and fry them till opaque, change color, turn crisp and are cooked completely. In between, stir the potatoes with a slotted spoon. Tip: You can use any neutral flavored oil. I generally use either peanut oil or sunflower oil. Once the potato cubes look crispy and are light golden or golden and tender, remove then with a slotted spoon – draining as much oil as you can. Place the fried potatoes on a kitchen paper towel. In the same oil, add 200 to 250 grams of chopped okra (bhindi) and sauté until fully cooked and tender. You can check if it’s done by inserting a knife—if it goes through easily, the okra is cooked. I suggest chopping the okra into 1 to 1.25-inch pieces for this recipe. Place the fried okra on a kitchen paper towel to remove excess oil. In the same oil, add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions (1 medium-sized onion). Sauté, stirring at intervals, until translucent or light brown. Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and sauté for some seconds or till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic goes away. Next, add 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes (2 medium-sized tomatoes). Sauté, stirring at intervals, till soft and pulpy. Next, add all the spice powders, except garam masala powder and dried mango powder (amchur powder): ½ teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin) 1 teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander) ¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper or paprika ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric) 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) – optional. Skip adding it if you want to make the dish gluten-free or use a gluten-free asafoetida. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes or until the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala mixture. Add the fried potatoes and sautéed okra. Stir gently until the whole masala mixture coats both the potatoes and okra. Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder, ¼ to ½ teaspoon dried mango powder and salt as required. Mix very well and sauté for a minute. Lastly, add ¼ teaspoon crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and sauté for a minute more. Note: If you do not have dried mango powder, add ¼ to ½ teaspoon lemon juice. Omit the dried fenugreek leaves too, if you do not have it. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve Aloo Bhindi hot or warm. Serving Suggestions With Indian flatbre: Aloo Bhindi tastes the best with Indian flatbre like Roti , Paratha or Naan. Sides to serve: You can also team up some plain Curd (yogurt) or a simple raita ( Cucumber Raita or Onion Raita ) along with it. A simple Kachumber Salad also works well. In the above photo, I have paired with Vegetable Raita. As a side dish: You can serve this Bhindi Aloo as a side dish with Khichdi , Dal Fry , Punjabi Kadhi or with any other Indian curry or lentil dish paired with steamed rice. Lunch box: You can pack Aloo Bhindi with some chapati or paratha for lunch box. Storage Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. To reheat, warm it in a pan on low heat or use a microwave. Add a splash of water if it feels too dry and mix evenly to combine. Expert Tips Buying okra: Always buy okra pods that are fresh, tender and young. Avoid buying okra that is stringy or mature. Prepping okra: After rinsing the okra, always dry thoroughly with a kitchen towel before chopping. You can spread the okra on a large plate or tray and let it dry naturally. Remember not to chop wet okra as this will make it slimy. Cooking potatoes: If you prefer, you can also steam or boil the potatoes and then include in the recipe. Remember that the steamed or boiled potatoes will give a different texture and taste to the recipe. Choice of fat: This dish can be prepared with any neutral flavored oil or even ghee (clarified butter). I personally prefer making it with sunflower or peanut oil. Spices: When making for small kids, then add less ginger-garlic paste, garam masala powder and red chili powder. Gluten-free variation: To make the dish gluten free, omit adding asafoetida or use a gluten-free asafoetida. Scaling: The recipe of Aloo Bhindi can easily be scaled to make a larger batch. What are the ingredients in Aloo Bhindi? The classic Aloo Bhindi includes okra (bhindi), potatoes (aloo), onions, tomatoes, and spices like turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and sometimes garam masala or dry mango powder (amchur) for tang. In my version, I sauté the okra first to reduce sliminess, fry the potatoes separately, and then mix both with a sautéed mix of onions, tomatoes, ginger-garlic paste, and a balanced blend of spices including amchur. This brings out a style flavor that’s simple yet delicious. Can I skip onions and garlic in this recipe? Yes, for a satvik version, simply omit onions and garlic. The spices, tomatoes, and ginger will still give plenty of flavor. Can I use boiled potatoes instead of raw? Yes, you can use boiled potatoes for a quicker version. Just add them with the sautéed bhindi.

You can also let them dry naturally. Cut the bhindi into 1 to 1.25 inch pieces. Make smaller pieces as they will be quick to fry. Frying Potatoes & Okra Heat 3 to 4 tablespoons oil in a kadai or pan. You can use any neutral flavored oil. First add the potatoes and fry them till they become opaque, change color and become crisp and are cooked completely.

In the same oil, add the chopped okra and sauté till all okra pieces are tender and softened or cooked completely. Drain the fried okra on paper towels to remove excess oil. To check – insert a knife into the sautéed okra; if it slides in easily, it’s cooked. Cooking Onions, Tomatoes & Spices In the same oil, add the finely chopped onions.

Lunch box: You can pack aloo bhindi and some roti for lunch box. Notes Make sure to dry the okra pods thoroughly after rinsing. Okra pods with any water droplets on them will become sticky and slimy while chopping and cooking. Use okra pods that are green, fresh and tender. For a gluten-free version skip adding the asafoetida or use gluten-free asafoetida. When making for small kids, you could reduce the amounts of ginger-garlic paste, garam masala powder and red chili powder. The potatoes can be steamed or boiled instead. But make a note that the soft texture of steamed or boiled potatoes will give a different flavor and taste. This recipe can be doubled or tripled.

Reply Hi Dassana, This was the first time i tried my hand at cooking.. You have illustrated it very well. Makes it even more easy for beginners like me. My Aloo Bhindi dish was a great hit amongst family and colleagues! Looking for more of your recipes.. Also can you please suggest any recipes for Soya? Reply welcome krutika and thanks for this positive feedback. i don’t use soya for health reasons. Reply I followed these tips and made awesome non sticky bhindi. The first time I have ever done it without regretting buying the bhindi so wanted to share with my fellow bhindi lovers. Warning: it is a little involved but turns out great results. Chop bhindi however(mine was in rounds). You can skip this step, if you wash bhindi, wait for couple hours and chop. I wanted to make certain mine was totally dry before chopping. Non sticks shouldnt be heated higher than med, else they get ruined. Fry until slightly brownish green, unless you really love deep fried bhindi sabji. When all bhindies are fried, use remaining oil for sabji. Don’t add any water to sabji or cover at all. Both will introduce moisture to the dish, which you are trying to avoid. If your sabji is too dry, or you think it will burn, you can reduce heat and add oil by 1/2 tsps. When sabji masala is done, take pan off fire, then add bhindies and mix well. Let this sabji cool before covering.

    "content": "Aloo Bhindi is a delicious Indian side dish of stir fried okra with potatoes, spices and herbs. This flavorsome North Indian dish is simple, easy to make and goes well with steamed rice, roti, parathas, chapati or any flatbre. Aloo Bhindi is one of those comforting dishes that require just a handful of ingredients but turns out so good that you won’t stop making it again & again. Jump To Recipe 195 shares Aloo Bhindi It is said that Aloo Bhindi originated in the Punjabi Cuisine but today you can find it being made and enjoyed all over India with regional variations. It is a common dish made in the s and often served in restaurants in a North Indian thali (meal). Basically it is a dry curry, also known as sabzi and it does not have any sauce. The most basic version is made with just okra, potatoes, chili powder, amchur (dried mango powder) and a sprinkle of garam masala. Many people also use onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic and plenty of other ground spices. You will also find cooks like me experimenting with curry leaves and mustard seeds. Each variation brings a new dimension to the aloo bhindi. I make this in 2 ways – one is to add potatoes in this Bhindi Masala which yields a little sauce. I’m sharing the second one in this post and also sharing many tried and tested variations below. If you love making tangy, spicy and sweet curry with bhindi, check out this Okra Curry. At we love bhindi and this one makes to our often. It is a kids’ friendly recipe and you can make it less hot/spicy to suit their palate. Here I have not used onions just to save 20 mins time but if you want you can use them. Tomatoes are optional and you may leave them out if you want and simply use amchur or lemon juice for the tang. Here is the picture of the same, made without onions and tomatoes. My family prefers Aloo Bhindi with tomatoes because they impart tang, adds so much flavor and keeps the dish a little moist without drying out. However you can still leave them out to save 8 to 10 minutes of your time.

If you want to make 2 servings, cut down the quantities by half. Rinse 1.1 lb (½ kg) bhindi under running water and pat dry or air dry until all of the moisture from the surface is gone. Water droplets on the okra can make your sabzi more slimy while cooking. Rinse and peel 320 grams (3 medium) potatoes and rinse 2 small tomatoes (150 grams). Dice the potatoes to ¾ inch pieces and add them to a bowl of water as you dice. If you want you can also rinse them well and pour fresh water. This removes the excess starch and prevents them from sticking to each other. Chop the bhindi to ¾ to 1 inch pieces. You can also do this while you stir fry the potatoes. Pour 1 to 1½ tablespoon oil to a wide pan and heat it. Remove the potatoes from water and add them here. Spread them to a single layer and let them fry on a medium high heat. While you fry these you may chop the bhindi and slice 4 medium garlic cloves to make 1 to 1½ tablespoons. Or use 1 inch ginger peeled and sliced. Stir them and cook until they are fork tender, meaning fully cooked. Remove these to a plate and keep aside. To the same pan add another 1½ tablespoon oil and add the sliced garlic cloves. Add the bhindi and fry them on a medium heat until all the slime has gone and they are cooked. Stir them every few minutes but do not over do as the okra can release more slime. You may leave out the tomatoes and use amchur or lemon juice later. While the bhindi is frying, quarter 2 medium tomatoes and add them to a grinder. Using more tomatoes is likely going to make the dish mushy because you need to cook longer to evaporate the moisture in tomatoes. When the bhindi is done they looked wilted and shrunk. Add the aloo and the following spices: ⅛ teaspoon turmeric (optional, add more if you want) ¾ to 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder (adjust to taste, I use 2 teaspoons) ¾ to 1½ teaspoon garam masala (adjust to taste or ½ tsp cumin & 1 tsp coriander powder, use ¾ to 1 teaspoon if you don’t use tomatoes) ⅓ teaspoon salt (more if you use tomatoes) 11. Mix and stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Move the veggies aside and make a well in the center. Pour the tomato puree (½ to ¾ cup, no more) and let it cook (without mixing) on a medium high heat until most of the moisture is reduced. Mix and stir fry on a medium high heat until the raw smell of tomatoes is gone. This takes me another 4 to 5 mins. If you cook on a low heat at this stage your bhindi can become mushy. Taste test and add more salt, garam masala or red chili powder to suit your liking. Add 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). If you left our tomatoes, then add 1 teaspoon amchur or add lemon juice while serving. Optionally garnish aloo bhindi with 1 tablespoon coriander leaves. Serve hot with steamed rice, roti, chapati or any flatbre. Pro Tips Wipe dry the bhindi to prevent them turning more slimy. Chop the bhindi to medium sized pieces. If they are too thin, they will let out too much slime. If they are too large, you will take a lot of time to cook them and sometimes you can feel the slime inside while eating. Make sure the slime has gone completely before adding tomatoes because any kind of moisture is likely to make the bhindi slimy. Tomatoes are used in the pureed form to cook them faster. Though chopped tomatoes work, they take longer to cook down and loose the raw flavor. Variations To use onions, slice one large onion and start by sautéing the onions in 2 tablespoons oil, followed by garlic or 2 teaspoons ginger garlic paste and then bhindi. Use tomatoes the same way as shown in the recipe. Another method is to make the onion tomato masala and then add the fried bhindi and aloo. You may check out this bhindi masala for that. Give a South Indian touch to this aloo bhindi by using curry leaves. You can also add Idli podi, peanut podi, dry garlic chutney (vada pav chutney), flax seed podi or fresh/frozen coconut. This version tastes better without tomatoes. I have shared it here on Vendakkai Fry. Sprinkle as much as you like towards the end. Use less salt while cooking the bhindi if using podi because it is already salted. But note that the dish is going to turn out dry. Related Recipes Okra Curry Sauteed Okra Reci...

Pat dry the okra or leave aside to air dry to remove any surface moisture. ▢ Peel and dice/chop potatoes to ¾ inch pieces and add them to a bowl of water as you dice. ▢ Pour half of the oil to a hot pan. Remove the potatoes from water and add them to the hot pan. ▢ Spread them to a single layer and let them cook on a medium heat. Keep stirring every few minutes to fry/cook them evenly, until fork tender but not mushy. ▢ While the potatoes fry, chop okra to ¾ to 1 inch pieces and slice the garlic cloves. ▢ When the potatoes are fork tender, remove them to a plate. How to Make Aloo Bhindi ▢ Pour the rest of the oil to the pan and add the sliced garlic. Fry for 30 seconds and add the okra. Spread them in the pan and let cook on a medium heat until all of the slime has vanished & they are almost cooked. ▢ While they fry, stir them every few minutes so they cook evenly. Overdoing this can make them more slimy. Optionally- add the quartered tomatoes to a small grinder/blender and puree them. ▢ When the bhindi is almost cooked, add the potatoes, red chili powder, turmeric, salt and garam masala (or cumin & coriander powder). Stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes on a medium heat. ▢ If using tomatoes, move the veggies aside & pour the puree to the base of the pan in the center. Increase the heat to medium high and let cook without stirring, until most of the moisture from tomatoes is gone. ▢ Mix the tomatoes well with the rest of the veggies and continue to saute for a few more minutes until the raw smell of tomatoes has gone completely, for 4 to 5 minutes. ▢ Taste test and add more salt or chili or garam masala at this stage to suit your liking. Add kasuri methi and amchur (if not using tomatoes) and mix well. ▢ Serve Aloo Bhindi with rice, quinoa, roti or with any flatbre of choice. Notes Use lesser spices if you don’t use tomatoes. More spices are required if you use tomatoes. You can use 2 to 3 small tomatoes (½ to ¾ cup pureed tomatoes) for half kg bhindi. Using more tomatoes is likely to overcook your okra and make them mushy.

Thank you Reply Aloo Bhindi is a delicious Indian side dish of stir fried okra with potatoes, spices and herbs. I’m Swasthi Shreekanth, the recipe developer, food photographer & food writer behind Swasthi’s Recipes. Aloo Bhindi is a simple Indian dish of potatoes and okra stir fried together with spices and tomatoes. Pour the rest of the oil to the pan and add the sliced garlic. If using tomatoes, move the veggies aside & pour the puree to the base of the pan in the center. Use lesser spices if you don’t use tomatoes",

    "content": "Jump to Recipe Pin Recipe Aloo bhindi is easy to prepare and tastes incredibly delicious dry sabzi recipe. This is Punjabi style side dish goes well with roti or regular dal-chawal. ❤️ This Aloo Bhindi Recipe Simple & Easy: This aloo bhindi is a one-pot dish and super easy to make. Shallow fry the potatoes and okra separately. Then add into Punjabi style onion-tomato masala. Include into the weekly : Because this aloo bhindi is healthy, hearty and super satisfying dry veggie preparation, you can add this into your weekly. Whenever okra is in season, I make sure to make it at least once a week. Pack into lunch-box: This makes the excellent lunch-box when packed with roti or dal-rice. 🧾 Ingredient Notes Here is the pic of the ingredients you’ll need to make easy, tasty aloo bhindi fry. Please read the notes mentioned below. Okra: I always prefer to buy desi okra from the Indian grocery stores. These are long and thin with fewer seeds. The one you get in American stores is really thick and has bigger size seeds which I do not prefer. Always wash the okra and let it air dry completely before slicing. If in the rush then wipe it dry using a towel. Okra, knife and cutting board must be dry to keep the sliminess to a minimum. Also, keep wiping the knife with a paper towel at intervals while cutting. Potato: When it comes to Indian cooking, I prefer to use red skin potato or Yukon gold potatoes. I do not suggest using Idaho or russet potatoes. Spices: All of them are very basic and used in everyday Indian cooking, nothing fancy. Ginger garlic: Most of the time I prefer to freshly grate my ginger and garlic. Alternately you can use store-bought or made ginger garlic paste. 👩‍🍳 How To Make Aloo Bhindi? (Pics) 1) Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot add bhindi, sprinkle some salt. 2) Cook uncovered until they get cooked and tender. Do stir once or twice in between. Okra gets darker in color and also shrinks as it cooks. Once they are cooked, there will not be any sliminess present. 3) In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. 4) Roast until potatoes are knife tender. 5) Remove it to the same plate with okra. 6) In the same pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Once hot add cumin seeds and let them sizzle a bit. 7) Then add chopped onions and sprinkle a little salt to speed up the cooking process. 8) Mix and cook until onions are soft and light pink in the color. Mix and saute for a minute or until the smell of ginger-garlic goes away. 10) Then add tomatoes (chopped or pureed). 11) Cook until all the moisture evaporates and it becomes thick. 12) Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, amchur and garam masala. 13) Mix and cook for 30-40 seconds. 14) Now add cooked bhindi and potatoes. 15) Mix and cook for 3-4 minutes until everything gets hot and flavors are combined. If not serving right away then keep aloo bhindi pan covered so it stays warm. 💭 Expert Tips For Making Aloo Bhindi Buying okra: They should be long, fresh looking and dark green in color. Don’t buy those who have blemishes, cut or leaked internal juice. Try to buy those who have fewer seeds in it. Avoid sliminess of the okra: 1) Okra should be dry before you chop them. 2) keep cleaning the knife as soon as it gets sticky. 3) While cooking okra stir only 2 or 3 times only. If you stir too many times, it gets slimy. 🍽 Serving Ideas For Aloo Bhindi Serve aloo bhindi with roti. Serve kachumber salad and chaas on the side. This can be served as a side dish with your everyday dal chawal, sambar rice or rasam rice. FAQs Why not cook okra and potatoes at the same time? Both require a different amount of time to cook. So by the time potatoes are ready, okra gets super soft and mushy. So it is better to cook separately. Can I cook okra and potatoes in the Air fryer? Yes, you can. This way aloo bhindi sabzi gets ready quickly. While these are cooking in the air fryer, make onion tomato masala on the stove. Preheat the air fryer to 350 ° F. For okra: 5 mins, toss, another 5 mins. For potatoes (depending on the size you cut): 15-20 mins, toss once in between cooking.
