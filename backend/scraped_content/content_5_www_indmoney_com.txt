These two giants are always trying to be the best in India's fast-growing delivery world. But who's actually ahead in this race? Looking at some recent numbers, Eternal, also known as Zomato, seems to have an edge in several key areas. For instance, Zomato earned a massive ₹5,000 crore more in revenue than Swiggy last year and also managed to attract 58 lakh more customers on average who order regularly. In the super-fast grocery delivery space, known as quick commerce, Zomato’s Blinkit also delivers 3.6 lakh more orders every single day compared to Swiggy’s Instamart. In this blog, we'll simply break down how Zomato and Swiggy compare on important things like money earned, number of customers, and their performance in the quick grocery delivery (quick commerce) game, including who is making a profit.

While the numbers above give a clear picture based on the provided data, the Indian food and grocery delivery market is huge and always changing. Reports from market analysts often look at market share, which is like asking what piece of the whole pie each company has. Most recent reports suggest Zomato has a larger market share in food delivery, around 55-58%, while Swiggy holds 42-45%. In the quick commerce space, Zomato's Blinkit also appears to have an edge. Duopoly Concerns:Zomato and Swiggy are the two major players in the Indian food delivery market, collectively holding over 90% market share. This dominance has led to several concerns for restaurants, consumers, and the competitive landscape. Because they're so dominant, restaurants sometimes have to pay them a big chunk of money (like 30-40 rupees out of every 100) from each order. For customers, it can mean food delivery ends up costing more. For everyday users, this competition means more choices, better deals, and faster deliveries as both Zomato and Swiggy try to win you over. For those interested in the business side, Zomato's current numbers, especially its profitability and higher revenue, show strong performance. Both are big players, but Zomato currently seems to have the upper hand in several important areas based on the latest available figures. Revenue is like the total money a company makes from its sales before taking out expenses. Last year in FY25, Zomato’s parent Eternal reported 67% YoY (year-on-year) growth in revenue to ₹20,243 crore. While Swiggy grew at 35% to a revenue of ₹15,227 crore during the same period. This means Zomato made over ₹5,000 crore more than Swiggy. Thinking Swiggy's Stock:Some financial experts believe that Swiggy's stock could be undervalued. They think the market understands Swiggy is spending a lot on its quick commerce (Instamart), but might not be fully appreciating how big and profitable Instamart could become in the future.
