**How to Make Aloo Bhindi**

**Step 1: Fry Potatoes and Okra**

1. Make smaller pieces or cubes as they will be quick to fry. In a kadai or pan, heat 3 to 4 tablespoons oil. Once the oil becomes medium hot, add the potatoes and fry them till opaque, change color, turn crisp and are cooked completely. In between, stir the potatoes with a slotted spoon.

**Step 2: Prepare Okra**

Once the potatoes are cooked, add the okra to the pan and sauté or pan-fry them. 

**Step 3: Add Onion, Tomato, and Spices**

Add chopped onions, tomatoes, ginger-garlic paste, and a few spices to the pan. I also add hing (asafoetida), kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), and amchur (dry mango powder) for extra flavor and tang.

**Step 4: Combine and Cook**

Combine the fried potatoes and okra with the onion-tomato mixture and cook until the dish is well combined and the flavors are absorbed.

**How to Make Aloo Bhindi**

**Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients**

Rinse 1.1 lb (½ kg) bhindi under running water and pat dry or air dry until all of the moisture from the surface is gone. Rinse and peel 320 grams (3 medium) potatoes and rinse 2 small tomatoes (150 grams). Dice the potatoes to ¾ inch pieces and add them to a bowl of water as you dice. Chop the bhindi to ¾ to 1 inch pieces.

**Step 2: Fry the Potatoes**

Pour 1 to 1½ tablespoon oil to a wide pan and heat it. Remove the potatoes from water and add them here. Spread them to a single layer and let them fry on a medium high heat. Cook until they are fork tender, meaning fully cooked. Remove these to a plate and keep aside.

**Step 3: Fry the Bhindi**

To the same pan add another 1½ tablespoon oil and add the sliced garlic cloves. Add the bhindi and fry them on a medium heat until all the slime has gone and they are cooked. Stir them every few minutes but do not over do as the okra can release more slime.

**Step 4: Add the Spices and Cook**

When the bhindi is done they looked wilted and shrunk. Add the aloo and the following spices: ⅛ teaspoon turmeric (optional, add more if you want) ¾ to 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, ½ teaspoon amchur powder, and a sprinkle of garam masala. Stir well and cook for a few minutes.

**Note:** You can also use onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and plenty of other ground spices to make variations of Aloo Bhindi.
